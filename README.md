MEITAVVVVV WE GET IT THAT OTP IS A STRONG AUTHENTICATION METHOD BUT FFS MY ENTIRE GMAIL INBOX IS FULL OF RANDOM DIGITS FROM YOU, so I automated the proccess to atleast save time :)

please change it to a 2 devices authentication and have like a confirmation box appearing on the mobile's app as a 2FA whenever someone is trying to log in from a PC, instead of wasting time and memory sending one time passkeys to the Malshabim (please)

Kind regards, a very lazy person who doesn't want to press 11 keys to see his Dapar score (now he presses 3).
